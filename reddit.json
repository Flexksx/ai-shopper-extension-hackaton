  "Call me back when it‚Äôs *cheaper*",
  "I‚Äôm glad they made it so it wobbles. Thanks for that.",
  "Do I need a PS5 as well to use as base?",
  "It looks like a cheap knock off of the real thing. \nWhat were Sony's designers thinking?",
  "The OG ps4 was a GORGEOUS design. And then we got this shit.",
  "Disappoints to be honest. I‚Äôd love an Xbox series S style ps5 because I travel a lot and it‚Äôs just so easy to throw it in my bag and take it with me. \n\nI had the ps5 for a few months but that thing is a monstrosity - on par with the original PS3 in the design wtf stakes.. üòÇ",
  "I‚Äôd honestly prefer more of a Gaven Belson signature Box III type of design\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KbRA2RjhgQ?si=VcQqhyeran_okZFU",
  "The article mentioned that the console stands on its own.\n\nI was a PS5 hardware support specialist(until I left Sutherland (the contractor for Playstation‚Äôs call center) because of the insane abuse from customers and a lack of a leadership team) and a good 95% of our consoles that overheated, came from it being vertical with no other reasoning present.\n\nSo do with that information what you will.",
  "I literally chose to wait 3 years for the slim and this is how they did me. \nAm thinking about a Steam Deck now instead.",
  "Uglyyyyyy",
  "Not only does it look stupid but you also need a baseplate or whatever the fuck those clear things are to make it lay flat. Unfathomably stupid design for an otherwise amazing console.",
  "The design of the ps5 is awful.",
  "I hate the stand for the PlayStation 5 with a passion but I hate the look of the new models legs even more!",
  "I just wish it was a box, not this travesty of design",
  "I think that the original PS5 shape is fine. It‚Äôs a cool design. It could just do with being about the size of the original Xbox 360. \nI realIse that it‚Äôs not possible given the components &amp; cooling inside before anyone jumps down my throat.",
  "I was so disappointed in the slim model.  I was hoping the redesign would make it look like a normal appliance I could have under my TV without looking weird, but they just cranked up the weird unnecessary GaMeR aesthetic.  I don‚Äôt want a gamer wifi router with a popped collar.\n\nSay what you will about the Xbox, but both of their consoles are at least functionally designed and pleasant to see.",
  "It looks like it literally takes up almost the same space.",
  "It looks like what I look like when I suck in to try and convince myself I still fit into those jeans.",
  "Am I the only one who thinks it looks fine?",
  "This is the Tesla truck of consoles.",
  "Never buy digital only consoles, you might be locked out of your games once service ends.",
  "I wonder what the Japanese think of the ps5 design, maybe it's more for them?",
  "I really hope Sony learns from this and adopts a more utilitarian design for the PS6. My PS5 and Switch have really fucked with my entertainment center layout. I have to find space to store the PS5 vertically since it‚Äôs too fat to sit horizontally in the slots for devices and the Switch needs to be in a place where I can get to it easily so I can switch games but there‚Äôs also no ‚Äúlay down‚Äù option for Switch, it always has to be standing. I dont have one but let‚Äôs not let Xbox X off the hook either. \n\nThis generation is the WORST for practical console design.",
  "I like the physical eject button. \nIdk why touch buttons became a norm , they are awful.",
  "I know I‚Äôm in the minority, but I always liked the PS5 design. Perfect? Gods, no. Just happy to see someone still trying builds that aren‚Äôt simply **yet another** rectangular prism.",
  "I like the design, but this is the first time I've seen the awful plastic feet; such an odd choice.",
  "Please make it a box again. I miss the unassuming rectangle.",
  "Ugliest console ever made",
  "It is such a awful looking thing",
  "For me the PS5 design is so ugly. I was waiting for a slim version to buy because of it. Now I guess I'll get a switch.",
  "It looks like one of those knockoffs",
  "It‚Äôs not really that much smaller",
  "lol now the memes have become real: it looks like a clearance bin 20 quid router.",
  "Still looks like an RK900",
  "God damn it‚Äôs seriously such an ugly console.",
  "I don‚Äôt understand what everyone here was expecting Sony to change the design so much to the point that it would look like a standard appliance. Every single PlayStation revision has ALWAYS kept the design language of its original. \n\nAnd revisions always look cheaper because they are cheaper to make. It‚Äôs not showcased on the cost because of course it won‚Äôt be. \n\nPlus, these front facing images do not adequately showcase how much smaller it actually is. It‚Äôs not substantially smaller. But, the amount the PS5 has been slimmed down is not egregiously bad.",
  "Who gives a fuck what it looks like if it performs well?",
  "Still bulky",
  "PS5 is such a garbage design. The PS4 slim is so damn good looking in comparison to this thing. It looks like an old sky box from 2006 or something.",
  "It looks like a phone with a spicy battery.",
  "I was hoping for something more like the PS4 but somehow they made it look worse than the original PS5.",
  "My biggest question is why? It‚Äôs not that much smaller than the original, the design language is relatively the same, absolutely no changes to spec, this is for someone who is looking for the PS5 now as opposed to an upgrade",
  "It‚Äôs like Jonah Hill weight loss weird.",
  "don't forget that they'll be ewaste in 10 years when the activation servers for the disc drives goes offline. Then you'll have spent $400 on a console that cant phone home to download games from its store, and cant phone home to register its disc drive which knocks out physical games.",
  "This slim breaks tradition of the prior slim models. This was strictly an internal component improvement and size reduction to avoid a potential $550 price increase."
